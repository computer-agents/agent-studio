  "instruction": "A certain railway company in Hong Kong uses a signaling system to keep track of trains in its railway system. Each line in the docx file '${AS_ROOT}/docs/HK_train_record.docx' represents a train calling at a station from 0600 to 1200 on 2022-09-22, and has the following format: time_HH:MM:SS, train_id, station_id, platform_no.. I want to remove duplicated train ids in order to know how many different trains are running from 0600 to 1200. Could you help me on this? I am doing it manually and it is very inefficient.",
