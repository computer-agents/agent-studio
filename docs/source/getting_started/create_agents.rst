Create Your Own Agent
===============

Not satisfied with the existing agents? Create your own agent! This section will guide you through the process of creating a new agent.

Agents are stored in the ``agent_studio/agent`` directory. Each agent is a Python class that inherits from the ``BaseAgent`` class. The agent class must implement the following methods:

1. ``name: str``: A unique name for the agent. **The name should match the ``agent`` field in ``agent_studio/config/config.py``**.
2. ``trajectory2intermediate_msg(self) -> list[dict[str, Any]]``: Convert the trajectory to a list of intermediate messages. You can access all internal states of the agent, e.g. ``self.trajectories``, ``self.system_prompt``, and ``self.instruction``. Construct the intermediate messages based on these states. The intermediate messages is a list of messages.Each message is a dictionary with the following fields:
    - ``role: str``: The role of the message. It can be ``system``, ``user``, or ``assistant``.
    - ``content: str | np.array``: The content can be a string or a numpy array.
3. ``eval(self, final_obs: np.ndarray | None = None) -> dict[str, Any]``: Agent self-evaluation. The input is the final observation of the task (a screenshot if the current task is a visual task). You can use this information and past trajectories to construct the self-evaluation prompt. The method should return a dictionary with the following fields:
    - ``score: float``: The score of the agent trajectories.
    - ``feedback: str``: The feedback from the agent.
    - ``prompt: str``: The self-evaluation prompt. **Must be in the format of the intermediate message format.**
    - ``response: str``: The original response from the agent.

You may also want to implement the following methods:

1. ``reset(self, instruction: str) -> None:``: Reset the agent for a new task. This will read the task instructions and reset the agent's internal state. You can also read the system prompt here.
